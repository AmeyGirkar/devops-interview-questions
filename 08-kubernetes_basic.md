11. What is a Deployment?
	â€¢	Manages ReplicaSets.
	â€¢	Used for rolling updates and rollbacks.

12. What is a Service?
	â€¢	Exposes a set of Pods over a network.

	â€¢	Stores configuration data as key-value pairs.

15. What is Secret?
	â€¢	Stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords).

16. What is a Namespace?
	â€¢	Virtual cluster inside Kubernetes.
	â€¢	Separates resources.

17. What is a StatefulSet?
	â€¢	Manages stateful applications.
	â€¢	Provides stable identity and storage.

18. What is a DaemonSet?
	â€¢	Runs a copy of a Pod on all (or some) nodes.

19. What is a Job?
	â€¢	Creates Pods to run a task until it completes.

21. What is Ingress?
	â€¢	Manages external access to services.
	â€¢	Acts like a smart router.

22. What is a Helm Chart?
	â€¢	Package manager for Kubernetes applications.

23. What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?
	â€¢	Automatically scales Pods up/down based on CPU/memory usage.

24. What is Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)?
	â€¢	Automatically adjusts Pod CPU/memory requests.

25. What is Cluster Autoscaler?
	â€¢	Adds/removes nodes based on load.

26. What is a Persistent Volume (PV)?
	â€¢	Piece of storage provisioned for a Pod.

27. What is a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)?
	â€¢	Request for storage by a Pod.

28. Difference between Deployment and StatefulSet?
	â€¢	Deployment: for stateless apps.
	â€¢	StatefulSet: for stateful apps (like databases).

29. How do you perform a rolling update in Kubernetes?
	â€¢	Update Deployment object with a new image version.

30. What is a RollingUpdate strategy?
	â€¢	Gradually replace old Pods with new ones.

â¸»

31. What is a Blue-Green Deployment?
	â€¢	Two environments (blue: old, green: new).
	â€¢	Switch traffic to green after testing.

32. What is Canary Deployment?
	â€¢	Gradually shift traffic to the new version.

33. What is Node Affinity?
	â€¢	Schedules Pods to preferred nodes.

34. What is Taint and Toleration?
	â€¢	Taints: repel Pods from nodes.
	â€¢	Tolerations: allow Pods to run on tainted nodes.

35. What is a ResourceQuota?
	â€¢	Limits resource usage in a namespace.

36. What is a LimitRange?
	â€¢	Sets default resource limits/requests.

37. How does Kubernetes handle secrets securely?
	â€¢	Encrypts Secrets at rest (optional).
	â€¢	Access control using RBAC.

38. What is Kubernetes Dashboard?
	â€¢	Web UI to manage cluster resources.

39. What is RBAC in Kubernetes?
	â€¢	Role-Based Access Control.
	â€¢	Manages permissions.

40. How to update a running Pod?
	â€¢	Update the Deployment (Pods are recreated).

â¸»

41. Can you edit a Pod directly?
	â€¢	No, Pods are immutable.
	â€¢	Instead, update Deployment or recreate Pod.

42. What happens when a Pod crashes?
	â€¢	Controller (e.g., Deployment) automatically creates a new Pod.

43. What is Init Container?
	â€¢	Container that runs before the main app container starts.

44. What is a Sidecar Container?
	â€¢	Secondary container in a Pod that supports the main container.

45. How do you troubleshoot a Pod?
	â€¢	kubectl logs pod-name
	â€¢	kubectl describe pod pod-name

46. What is a Volume in Kubernetes?
	â€¢	Directory accessible to containers in a Pod.
	â€¢	For data sharing and persistence.

	â€¢	Kubernetes removes Pods when nodes are under resource pressure.

49. How do you expose a service externally?
	â€¢	Use NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress.
